# blagger

Remake of the C64/MSX game Blagger for the ZX Spectrum and ... possibly Amiga ...

Using the Nirvana+ engine for the Spectrum version.

Will include all the MSX levels and any extra ones from the C64 version of the game.

Also will check the [enhanced MSX version](https://sites.google.com/site/msxpage/msx-developed-software/blagger-enhanced-version)

Using the [Zalaxa tutorials](https://seven-fff.com/blog/) to learn how to use the Nirvana+ API and kickstart me into Z80 cross assembly

## Part 1

Learning the tools

For assembly I'm using ZEUS.

For artwork I'm using ZX Paintbrush as it handles the btile format required by Nirvana.

Will try and see how the original blagger sprites look once they are colourised.

Here's the original Roger the Dodger:
